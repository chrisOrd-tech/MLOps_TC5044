# Notebooks

Here goes the notebooks used for research and development.

# Notebooks Folder

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used for research and development in the project. These notebooks document the exploratory analysis, model development, and refactoring processes that led to the final implementation.

## Notebooks

- **`Risk_Factor_Prediction_Chronic_Kidney_disease.ipynb`**:  
  This notebook contains the initial research and development work for predicting risk factors of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The entire project, including data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, was conducted in this notebook format.

- **`Risk_Factor_Prediction_Chronic_Kidney_disease_Refactored.ipynb`**:  
  This notebook presents a refactored version of the original research. The code has been reorganized using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with classes and functions to provide the same functionality as the original notebook but in a more modular and maintainable way.

## Usage

The notebooks are self-contained and can be executed independently to reproduce the research and results. To run them, simply open the desired notebook in a Jupyter environment.
